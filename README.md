I watched this tutorial: 'How To Deploy ASP.NET Application with Azure SQL Database on Microsoft Azure Cloud'
https://youtu.be/jT8eA9A7qXE
It let me visually see what the app should look like. This particular tutorial did not explain the 'why' of what imports/etc were used. Just the 'what' and 'how'. 
I'm going to look at microsoft's modules on Azure sql database connectivity as they are well-written and see what I can find.

I found this awesome resource on learning system design. Well, a few. The donnemartin whatever one on github and this series of video lectures:

I think that learning system design would be best done with experience. Same for data structures and algorithms. I'm trying to build little apps to practice these things and to just have some sort of creative output.

Something to generally explore:
