# RemoteProjectRemo
Remote github repository for my personal projects.

I made a new repo and first thing I did was make a typo. Meant to write "Repo". lol. Eh, low stakes.

today, I started a tutorial on typescript and node.js
set up git repo. had to use personal token (due to 2-step authentication setup in my account?)
