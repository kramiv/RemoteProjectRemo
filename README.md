Remote github repository for my personal projects.

I will be figuring out a way to deploy some basic websites that will be easier to look at than this repo. 

I think I want to learn scala and try to deploy a full-stack app using just scala and aws. something primarily with those. probably start with just read and click functionality. 

At some point, I want to review C++ and do some data structures + algorithms with it. 

practice scaling some app and measuring performance using some tool.

Scala is a sibling to Java. Aws is a very common technology right now as well.

Can't really go wrong with any of these, I guess. I would like a tutorial that helps me study system design as well. 

I found this awesome resource on learning system design. Well, a few. The donnemartin whatever one on github and this series of video lectures:

I think that learning system design would be best done with experience. Same for data structures and algorithms. I'm trying to build little apps to practice these things and to just have some sort of creative output.

Something to generally explore:

want to practice microservices app and find a way to monitor performance as well.
