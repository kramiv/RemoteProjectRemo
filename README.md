# New Project

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like [@snowpack/plugin-webpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/plugins/plugin-webpack) or [snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle](https://github.com/ParamagicDev/snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle) to your `snowpack.config.mjs` config file.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.

# RemoteProjectRemo
Remote github repository for my personal projects.

I made a new repo and first thing I did was make a typo. Meant to write "Repo". lol. Eh, low stakes. 

I will be figuring out a way to deploy some basic websites that will be easier to look at than this repo. 



4/18/23:

today, I started a tutorial on typescript and node.js

set up git repo. had to use personal token (due to 2-step authentication setup in my account?)

working through this tutorial for a basic understanding: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBmrduvKl5w

There are a few other tutorials that have caught my eye. I would want to build them and then maybe add some new features to show learning.

Can't really go wrong with any of these, I guess. I would like a tutorial that helps me study system design as well. 

I found this awesome resource on learning system design. Well, a few. The donnemartin whatever one on github and this series of video lectures: 
https://www.youtube.com/@SystemDesignInterview

I think that learning system design would be best done with experience. Same for data structures and algorithms. I'm trying to build little apps to practice these things and to just have some sort of creative output.

Something to generally explore:
